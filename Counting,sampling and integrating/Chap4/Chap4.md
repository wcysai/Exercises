## Exercise 4.1

1. To prove that the MC is irreducible, we need to show that every two states of proper coloring is reachable from each other. Since $q\geq \Delta+2$, we can change the color of a single vertex to some assigned color $c$, by first changing all its neighbors with color $c$ to a different color, therefore every state is reachable, and thus the MC is irreducible.  For every two states $x$ and $y$ adjacent to each other(that is, the matching represented by $x$ and $y$ differs by exactly the color of one vertex.), then it's clear that $P(x,y)=P(y,x)$. Since this MC is clearly irreducible, then according to Lemma 3.7, the stationary distribution is uniform over $\Omega$.
2. For this problem, any graph with smallest degree $\delta=\Delta$ has such "frozen" coloring. For example, take $K_5$ and any proper coloring, its only transition leads to itself.
